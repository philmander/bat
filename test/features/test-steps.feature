Feature: API Testing Steps
  As an author of this library
  I want to test that all the steps work against a mock server
  So I can sleep at night

  Background: Anonymous usage
    Given I am anonymous
    Given I set the variables:
      | color | red |
      | lang  | nl  |

  Scenario: Testing Gets
    When GET "{base}/pets"
    And I add the query string parameters:
